Tutorial
========
Welcome to the Lightflow tutorial! This tutorial will guide you step by step through the development of a workflow. The emphasis is on showing you how to
model and implement typical workflow elements with Lightflow and to demonstrate the features Lightflow has to offer. Therefore, the workflow we are going
to create does nothing particularly sophisticated. So don't expect too much. We will push numbers around and perform some basic math operations on them.

Let's go! While we recommend that you follow the tutorial steps in order, you don't have to. Each tutorial step introduces a specific concept or feature
of Lightflow, so feel free to jump directly to the step that interests you most.
